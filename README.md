I will be making a game about a young man who is coming into himself as he must journey on a perilous quest through-out the world and accomplish his mission. he will have many tasks to complete with rewards that boost his power on multiple levels. Spirit, emotion, energy, thought, action, manifestaion, visualization, utilization, dexterity, speed, momentum, mass, magnitude. pulse wave, are emmited and received based on player level and intent stream(effect of thought and action) affects and effects are calculated in the overall mass/volume of the game and atmosphere. Every player will effect the world with the energy they emit. The character will gain greater control of the atmosphere based on choices. also his mood cycle and level of self attribute control will be effected by the game and elements involved. psychological realationships and strain from the game. Fundamental elements scripts.

character attributes:Health, Physical, Mental, Spritual, Emotional ENERETIC(a combination attribute, Base<Physical Capability+Spiritual/Health*Spiritual/Radiance) 
What can the character/player do? Jump, run, attack, cast, manifest, utilize-push-pull-place, puzzle games-word games, quizes, challenges, competition. fund rasing. strategy, brain teaser, lusk, risk, gamble.

Manifesting in game: Certain objects can be manifested by the Character/player in game through the manifestation menue. Manifestation costs eq. points, whether you have the points or not you can still manifest. the process is done by generating a chance of the "situation/event" to come about that would lead you to the manifestation object, or circumstance from the menue.
What makes this feature shine is the content of the game and the ability to engage the mind of the player. The chance to manifest items that would make quests and tasks easier. a special fishing pole that catches only high quality fish to sell at a easter egg vender that pops up around the map according to the algorithm. an article that points you in the direction of the fish buyer. A goal is needed for the accomplishing of the games mission. Cash reward for first to unlock easter egg achievements.
